Configuration Management 

Puppet  => Pull model | Master Slave | Puppet Language 
Ansible => Push model | Agentless |  inventory or Dynamic Inventory
	   | Good with the windows(ssh) / Linux(WinRM) | Simple (yaml language) | Can write 
	   own modules 
	=>  Can share the Ansible modules(Galaxy) | Uses Python preferable

Disadvantages of Ansible => (Slight difficult in Windows | Debugging | Performance ) =>Not 
			                                                 bad with the Ansible 
							                 Need to improve in 
									Ansible)
Follow through along with Ansible in AWS Cloud 

Step 1 : Create two or more ec2 instances
step 2 : Select one as a ansible configure server rest of them are target server
step 3 : To ssh to other servers from ansible_config server generate the ssh-keygen 
step 4 : Rewrite the authorized_keys credentials of other servers and replace the private 
	key of the ansible_server To authendicate without password 
	re the respective ip of the servers
 
step 5 : Write adhoc or playbooks to execute the script
adhoc (run one or two commands)  and playboo
step 6 : Create the inventory file and configuks to run (bunch of tasks)

step 6 : Configure nginx | apache | nodejs in all other server
To run ansible playbook -i inventory nginx.yml
---
- name: Install and Start nginx
  hosts: all
  become: true
    
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started


ansible playbook -i inventory apache.yml
---
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started


ansible playbook -i inventory nodejs.yml
---
- name: Install Node.js
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Node.js
      apt:
        name: nodejs
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

check in all server wheather it installed in all other servers


Ansible roles => To write a complex playbooks => To write the structured 
playbooks make easier to understand
ansible-galaxy role init Kubernetes
